Hello,
Here is the GitHub practice file.

As a user, I can create a new game.

Given the user is logged in
and there are no users waiting for games
when they hit the create game button
then a new game is added to their list of games and the game
shows it is waiting for another user to start.

Given the user is logged in
and there is another user waiting to play a game
when the user hits the create game button
then the game starts immediately.

Given the user is logged in
and has a game waiting to start
when another user joins the game
the game starts.

------

As a user, I can quit a game, because I'm tired of it.

As a user with a running game,
when I hit the close button
then the game is ended.

-----

As a user, I receive a notification when the other user quits.

As a user with a running game,
when the other user quits
then the game is ended and a message is displayed telling me the other user quit.

As a user, I can see that a game has ended
either because someone won or the other person quit
when I hit the close button
then the game is removed from my game page.

----

As a user, I can have multiple active, ended or waiting games displayed.

As a user, I can close any game.

As a user, I get a confirmation dialog box if I try to quit an active game.
